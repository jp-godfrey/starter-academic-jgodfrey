I am a PhD student in the Education Department (RESA) at the University of Southern Mississippi. I have served as an educator in multiple capacities such as Day Treatment Educator, Edgenuity facilitator, and an Independent Educational Consultant. My research centers on various aspects of STEM with a particular focus on diversity as it relates to women and minorities and campus climate specifically inclusion, support, and transition into the workforce. My research agenda includes statistical techniques and data analysis. Those specific techniques and analysis include predictive models, Kitagawa–Blinder–Oaxaca (KBO) decompositions, and quantitative analysis. Another line of inquiry that peaks my interest centers around programming languages such as R, SAS, and SPSS. I envision my approach to research as examination of the data. Although the background is important, I would like to focus on telling a story with the data that is collected or presented to me.
