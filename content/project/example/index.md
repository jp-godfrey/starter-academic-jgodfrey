title: COVID-19 Data Visualization as of April 24, 2020
summary: Coronavirus/Covid-19 is affecting countries throughout the word. Here in the United States many people have succumbed to this deadly virus. The Center of Disease Control, CDC, provides data that tracks multiple factors. This provisional data set contains data that may not be up to date because of reporting delays. The cause of death is based on what was reported on the death certificate. In the event that COVID-19 tests are not available, or results were not in by the time of death, the cause of death may be listed as influenza, pneumonia, or a combination of causes. The data set provided is as of April 24, 2020. The indicator data is grouped by weeks, ages, states, and place of death. This data can be used to compare cases at a certain point in time, compare factors, and possibly make predictions.

The data visualization file contains four data visualizations which each provide different
results. The data visualization labeled Covid-19 (States) displays all COVID-19 deaths by states.
The data is presented in a graduated color map. As the colors get darker, the death toll increase.
It allows us to explore the infected areas by location. The data in that map stood out to me
because areas with higher numbers are located near bodies of water. The color-coded bar graphs
show the deaths by age groups and cause of death categories. More individuals who are 85 +
years old dying than those that are younger age groups. The packed bubbles visualization show
the place of death. Most people who are dying from only COVID-19 are dying in healthcare
setting, impatient. Finally, the text table displays the deaths by all causes according to gender. In
every category, there are more males that are dying than women. Data visualization can tell a
story that actually paint an image. This data useful to all that are impacted.
